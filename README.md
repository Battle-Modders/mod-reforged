Welcome to Reforged. An overhaul mod for Battle Brothers focused on a cohesive and thematic design and built with mod compatibility in mind.

## DOCUMENTATION
A full list of Reforged's features can be found in [this Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19cXmlJk04UBCoPjUrT60A17kcGemKBMAak0abbf6Lhs/edit?usp=sharing). You can browse to different sheets within that document to view all the different features.

## INSTALLATION GUIDE
- For mods hosted on GitHub you should download the latest release from the **Releases** page. For this, download the mod *.zip* file attached to the release.
- Place all the `.zip` files of the mods directly into your Battle Brothers `data` folder. **DO NOT** unzip the files.

### Required Mods
- Unified Perk Descriptions (link)
- Dynamic Perks Framework (link)

## REFORGED VISION
We have a grand vision and are lucky to have a team that is both dedicated and qualified to make it a reality.
- A highly robust and flexible dynamic perks system.
- Over 100 meticulously designed new perks.
- Reworked enemies with new perks, abilities and deeper theming.
- A flexible dynamic spawns system to tweak and scale enemy parties.
- A new Retinue system from the ground up.
- A livelier world with new entities and interactions on the world map.
- New mechanics related to combat.
- New enemies, items and contracts.
- Many QoL improvements.

### Pillars
Considering the scale of the project, we have established guidelines to direct our focus throughout development. The following are our pillars:

#### Design
- Variety – Add content that increases variety and replayability in the game.
- Depth - Improve depth in systems where appropriate while maintaining usability.
- Simplicity - Effort should be made to avoid unnecessary complexity in features.
- Immersion – Features should be believable within the theme of the vanilla game.
- Value – Features should not be added for the sake of adding more content. Each feature should add value to the game and not overshadow other features.
- Cohesion – Features of the mod should nicely fit together and with vanilla systems to provide a cohesive experience.
- Scale – Stick to the vanilla game’s vision of the player being a mercenary band in a harsh world. The world has a greater impact on the player than vice versa.
- Balance – The game should be just hard enough that it feels challenging at all stages of the gameplay, and just easy enough that a player can win with skill. Life should not be easy, but skill should be rewarded.

While most of these sound rather open-ended, these pillars help us critically analyze every feature proposal for the mod and stick to a coherent, productive design.

#### Tech
On the back-end (code) side of things, we intend to write Reforged in a modular, highly compatible way. As Reforged makes many leaps and pushes the boundaries of Battle Brothers moddability, we intend to introduce new tools and frameworks which will help not only us but also other modders. Our tech pillars are:

- Frameworks – Implement back-end frameworks for large features. These frameworks should work in a modular and stand-alone fashion.
- Compatibility – Effort should be made to write code in a way that ensures maximum compatibility with other mods or sub-mods.
- Documentation – We should provide documentation to use the mod’s frameworks and code back-end for both our own developers and sub-modders.
