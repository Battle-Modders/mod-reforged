What is this all for, if not to teach others..?\n\nRealizing your failures, you set aside your blade once more, turning about and heading back to your meager estate. Perhaps this was all a waste of time, a lesson in loneliness and foolhardy wanderlust. If only you had some students to guide, to carry on your legacyâ€¦ alas, that has now passed you by.
